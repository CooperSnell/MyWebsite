	<h2><font color=123456 size="5">Hello, my name is Cooper Snell and welcome to my webpage! I am a student at Damien High School, and I play on the junior varsity baseball team. I am apart of the 2022 graduate class, and my goal is to graduate from Damien and attend a UC college. It will not be an easy task to get accepted into a UC college but I am an honor roll student with many extracurricular activities, so I am headed down the right path. My homepage will be a general guideline for my entire website. Under the about me tab I will have information about my life such as hobbies, sports, and extracurricular activities. Under the portfolio tab I will have all of my work such as projects, activities, and assignments. </h2>
