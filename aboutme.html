<h2><font color="123456" size="5">Hello, my name is Cooper Snell. I am an only child with a family of four, including my father, mother, and dog. My favorite activities include spending time with family and friends, playing baseball, and videogames. One of my favorite things I like to eat is pasta, burgers, and steak. Some things that I do not like are tests, homework, and running. My favorite hobby is working for Heroes and Patriots, I help feed veterans and their families on holidays and give toys to the children who normally do not receive anything. My favorite type of music is rap, and I can listen to it all day. I have a fear of heights, which ruins a lot of experiences for me. To contact me email me at CDSnell22@damien-hs.edu   </font></h2>
